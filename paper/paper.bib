With the optimization of single-crystal growth methods, large-size and high-quality boron arsenide single crystals have been grown and thermal conductivity measurements have verified the related predictions. Benefiting from the increased size and improved qualities, additional properties have been characterized. Important factors related to boron arsenide, remaining challenges, and the future outlook are addressed in this minireview.},

abstract = {Raman microscopy in the lattice phonon region coupled with X-ray diffraction have been used to study the polymorphism in crystals and microcrystals of the organic semiconductor 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) obtained by various methods. While solution grown specimens all display the well-known monoclinic structure widely reported in the literature, by varying the growth conditions two more polymorphs have been obtained, either from the melt or by sublimation. By injecting water as a nonsolvent in a DPA solution, one of the two new polymorphs was predominantly obtained in the shape of microribbons. Lattice energy calculations allow us to assess the relative thermodynamic stability of the polymorphs and verify that the energies of the different phases are very sensitive to the details of the molecular geometry adopted in the solid state. The mobility channels of DPA polymorphs are shortly investigated.},

abstract = {Thermoelectric materials, which can generate electricity from waste heat or be used as solid-state Peltier coolers, could play an important role in a global sustainable energy solution. Such a development is contingent on identifying materials with higher thermoelectric efficiency than available at present, which is a challenge owing to the conflicting combination of material traits that are required. Nevertheless, because of modern synthesis and characterization techniques, particularly for nanoscale materials, a new era of complex thermoelectric materials is approaching. We review recent advances in the field, highlighting the strategies used to improve the thermopower and reduce the thermal conductivity.},
