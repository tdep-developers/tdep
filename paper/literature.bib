  abstract = {{The dynamical properties of nuclei, carried by the concept of phonon quasiparticles, are central to the field of condensed matter. While the harmonic approximation can reproduce a number of properties observed in real crystals, the inclusion of anharmonicity in lattice dynamics is essential to accurately predict properties such as heat transport or thermal expansion. For highly anharmonic systems, non perturbative approaches are needed, which result in renormalized theories of lattice dynamics. In this article, we apply the Mori-Zwanzig projector formalism to derive an exact generalized Langevin equation describing the quantum dynamics of nuclei in a crystal. By projecting this equation on quasiparticles in reciprocal space, and with results from linear response theory, we obtain a formulation of vibrational spectra that fully accounts for the anharmonicity. Using a mode-coupling approach, we construct a systematic perturbative expansion in which each new order is built to minimize the following ones. With a truncation to the lowest order, we show how to obtain a set of self-consistent equations that can describe the lineshapes of quasiparticles. The only inputs needed for the resulting set of equations are the static Kubo correlation functions, which can be computed using path-integral molecular dynamics or approximated with (classical or ab initio) molecular dynamics.}},

  abstract = {{Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental–theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in‐plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat‐carrying modes around ≈0.1 THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out‐of‐plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD‐based (opto‐)electronic applications. Combined experimental–theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe2 crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in‐plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat‐carrying low‐frequency mode. Out‐of‐plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.}},

By invoking a low-frequency anharmonic feature, we are able to reproduce the Raman spectral line-shapes and integrated intensity temperature dependence. Numerical simulations support our interpretation of this low-frequency mode as a transition between two minima of a double-well potential surface. The model can be applied to other dynamically disordered crystal phases, providing a better understanding of the structural dynamics, leading to favorable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties in functional materials.}},

The regularities in rare-earth element hydrides unveiled here provide clues to guide the search for other synthesizable hydrides and candidate high-temperature superconductors. The hydrogen content variability in lanthanum hydrides and the samples’ phase heterogeneity underline the challenges related to assessing potentially superconducting phases and the nature of electronic transitions in high-pressure hydrides.

We also prove that for any low-dimensional material the bending modes can have a purely out-of-plane polarization in the vacuum direction and a quadratic dispersion in the long-wavelength limit. In addition, we propose an effective approach to treat invariance conditions in crystals with non-vanishing Born effective charges where the long-range dipole-dipole interactions induce a contribution to the lattice potential and stress tensor.

  abstract = {{Lead‐based halide perovskite crystals are shown to have strongly anharmonic structural dynamics. This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photovoltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead‐free alternative for optoelectronic applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photovoltaic activity of the lead‐based halide perovskites. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in lead‐based halide perovskites, the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 are investigated and are compared to its lead‐based analog, CsPbBr3. Using temperature‐dependent Raman measurements, it is found that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well‐defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal‐mode picture above 200 K. It is suggested that the breakdown of the normal‐mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our main findings, an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 is also discovered below ≈37 K. Raman spectroscopy is used to compare the anharmonic expressions in the structural dynamics of two halide perovskites. In Cs2AgBiBr6, clear normal modes are observed in all measured temperatures. Contrary to this, the Raman spectrum of CsPbBr3 exhibits a breakdown of the normal‐mode picture above 200 K. Implications of these diverging behaviors on the electronic properties of the crystals is discussed.}},

  abstract = {{The efficient and accurate calculation of how ionic quantum and thermal fluctuations impact the free energy of a crystal, its atomic structure, and phonon spectrum is one of the main challenges of solid state physics, especially when strong anharmonicy invalidates any perturbative approach. To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) method. This technique rigorously describes the full thermodynamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the SSCHA and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical inter pretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used for the implementation, which allows for a clean interaction with other packages. We briefly present a toy-model calculation to illustrate the potential of the code. Several applications of the method in superconducting hydrides, charge-density-wave materials, and thermoelectric compounds are also reviewed.}},

Strong anharmonicity near the phase transition induces non-Lorentzian shapes of the phonon power spectra. To account for these effects, we implement a method of calculating κ based on the Green-Kubo approach and find that the Boltzmann transport equation underestimates κ near the phase transition.

Its use is straightforward and require only a single ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) trajectory. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also available, making the use even easier. We detail our home made implementation of the original “Temperature Dependent Effective Potential” method proposed by Hellman et al. (2011). In particular, we present the various algorithms and schemes used in a-TDEP which enable to obtain the effective Interatomic Force Constants (IFC). The 2nd and 3rd order effective IFC are produced self-consistently using a least-square method, fitting the AIMD forces on a model Hamiltonian function of the displacements. In addition, we stress that we face to a constrained least-square problem since all the effective IFC have to fulfill the several symmetry rules imposed by the space group, by the translation or rotation invariances of the system and by others. Numerous thermodynamic quantities can be computed starting from the 2nd order effective IFC. The first one is the phonon spectrum, from which a large number of other quantities flow : internal energy, entropy, free energy, specific heat... The elastic constants and other usual elastic moduli (the bulk, shear and Young moduli) can also be produced at this level. Using the 3rd order effective IFC, we show how to extract the thermodynamic Grüneisen parameter, the thermal expansion, the sound velocities... and in particular, how to take into account the anisotropy of the system within. As representative applications of a-TDEP capabilities, we show the thermal evolution of the soft phonon mode of α -U, the thermal stabilization of the bcc phase of Zr and the thermal expansion of diamond Si.

Methods based on parameter fitting in the spirit of interatomic potentials, on the other hand, can extract FC parameters from semi‐random configurations of high information density and advanced regularized regression methods can recover physical solutions from a limited amount of data. Here, the hiphive Python package, that enables the construction of force constant models up to arbitrary order is presented. hiphive exploits crystal symmetries to reduce the number of free parameters and then employs advanced machine learning algorithms to extract the force constants. Depending on the problem at hand, both over and underdetermined systems are handled efficiently. The FCs can be subsequently analyzed directly and or be used to carry out, for example, molecular dynamics simulations. The utility of this approach is demonstrated via several examples including ideal and defective monolayers of MoS2 as well as bulk nickel. The hiphive package is a powerful tool for the efficient extraction of high‐order force constants.

  abstract = {{Lead chalcogenides have exceptional thermoelectric properties and intriguing anharmonic lattice dynamics underlying their low thermal conductivities. An ideal material for thermoelectric efficiency is the phonon glass–electron crystal, which drives research on strategies to scatter or localize phonons while minimally disrupting electronic-transport. Anharmonicity can potentially do both, even in perfect crystals, and simulations suggest that PbSe is anharmonic enough to support intrinsic localized modes that halt transport. Here, we experimentally observe high-temperature localization in PbSe using neutron scattering but find that localization is not limited to isolated modes – zero group velocity develops for a significant section of the transverse optic phonon on heating above a transition in the anharmonic dynamics. Arrest of the optic phonon propagation coincides with unusual sharpening of the longitudinal acoustic mode due to a loss of phase space for scattering. Our study shows how nonlinear physics beyond conventional anharmonic perturbations can fundamentally alter vibrational transport properties. To optimize the performance of lead chalcogenides for thermoelectric applications, strategies to further reduce the crystal’s thermal conductivity is required. Here, the authors discover anharmonic localized vibrations in PbSe crystals for optimizing the crystal’s vibrational transport properties.}},

  abstract = {{The conventional first-principles theory for the thermal and thermodynamic properties of insulators is based on the perturbative treatment of the anharmonicity of crystal bonds. While this theory has been a successful predictive tool for strongly bonded solids such as diamond and silicon, here we show that it fails dramatically for strongly anharmonic (weakly bonded) materials, and that the conventional quasiparticle picture breaks down at relatively low temperatures. To address this failure, we present a unified first-principles theory of the thermodynamic and thermal properties of insulators that captures multiple thermal properties within the same framework across the full range of anharmonicity from strongly bonded to weakly bonded insulators. This theory features a new phonon renormalization approach derived from many-body physics that creates well-defined quasiparticles even at relatively high temperatures, and it accurately captures the effects of strongly anharmonic bonds on phonons and thermal transport. Using a prototypical strongly anharmonic material, sodium chloride (NaCl), as an example, we demonstrate that our new first-principles framework simultaneously captures the apparently contradictory experimental observations of large thermal expansion and low thermal conductivity of NaCl on the one hand, and anomalously weak temperature dependence of phonon modes on the other, while the conventional theory fails in all three cases. We demonstrate that four-phonon scattering due to higher-order anharmonicity significantly lowers the thermal conductivity of NaCl and is required for a proper comparison to experiment. Furthermore, we show that our renormalization framework, along with four-phonon scattering, also successfully predicts the measured phonon frequencies and thermal properties of a weakly anharmonic material, diamond, indicating universal applicability for thermal properties of insulators. Our work gives new insights into the physics of heat flow in solids, and presents a computationally efficient and rigorous framework that captures the thermal and thermodynamic properties of both weakly and strongly bonded insulators simultaneously.}},

However, it only includes three-phonon scattering due to the assumption that four-phonon and higher-order processes are generally unimportant. Also, directly evaluating the scattering rates of four-phonon and higher-order processes has been a long-standing challenge. In this work, however, we have developed a formalism to explicitly determine quantum mechanical scattering probability matrices for four-phonon scattering in the full Brillouin zone, and by mitigating the computational challenge we have directly calculated four-phonon scattering rates. We find that four-phonon scattering rates are comparable to three-phonon scattering rates at medium and high temperatures, and they increase quadratically with temperature. As a consequence, κ of Lennard-Jones argon is reduced by more than 60\% at 80 K when four-phonon scattering is included. Also, in less anharmonic materials—diamond, silicon, and germanium—κ is still reduced considerably at high temperature by four-phonon scattering by using the classical Tersoff potentials. Also, the thermal conductivity of optical phonons is dominated by the fourth- and higher-orders phonon scattering even at low temperature.}},

The meaning of a Debye characteristic temperature in the anharnionic theory is discussed, and the place of an empirical Debye temperature, determined by fitting specific heat measurements to a theoretical specific heat formula, is also considered.

The thermodynamical formulae of the anharmonic crystal can be given a simple form: they consist of the customary formulae for a set of harmonic oscillators, but now expressed in terms of new frequencies denned essentially from the quadratic and quartic terms in an expansion of the potential energy, plus correction terms which express the difference between the actual anharmonic motion and the harmonic approximation.

A model intermolecular potential is developed, which includes a reasonable distribution of electrostatic multipole interactions as well as the standard dispersive and repulsive interactions. The model gives a satisfactory prediction of the structure of the para electric phase, and in particular explains the occurrence of the hydrogen-bond network. Calculations of phonon-dispersion curves predict a soft-phonon branch in the b direction with the same symmetry as that observed experimentally. Computer simulations predict reasonable values for the vibrational amplitudes, and show the existence of large-amplitude fluctuations of an harmonic quantities at incommensurate wave vectors. However, although the model displays a strong tendency towards incommensurate and lock-in ordering, it does not in fact give a phase transition at a finite temperature. This failure is attributed to the neglect of molecular polarizability, and it is concluded that this feature provides the mechanism that stabilizes the low-temperature phases.For the interested reader, full details of the molecular dynamics simulation technique using parallel processing are presented here. In particular, a method of extracting normal-mode eigenvectors from the results of the simulations is described.}},

Using a lowest-order cluster expansion, the unambiguous prescription is obtained that a specific effective potential, softened by the Jastrow correlation function, replaces everywhere the true potential in the existing self-consistent theory of phonon damping applicable to nonsingular forces.
