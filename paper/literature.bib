  abstract = {{The dynamical properties of nuclei, carried by the concept of phonon quasiparticles, are central to the field of condensed matter. While the harmonic approximation can reproduce a number of properties observed in real crystals, the inclusion of anharmonicity in lattice dynamics is essential to accurately predict properties such as heat transport or thermal expansion. For highly anharmonic systems, non perturbative approaches are needed, which result in renormalized theories of lattice dynamics. In this article, we apply the Mori-Zwanzig projector formalism to derive an exact generalized Langevin equation describing the quantum dynamics of nuclei in a crystal. By projecting this equation on quasiparticles in reciprocal space, and with results from linear response theory, we obtain a formulation of vibrational spectra that fully accounts for the anharmonicity. Using a mode-coupling approach, we construct a systematic perturbative expansion in which each new order is built to minimize the following ones. With a truncation to the lowest order, we show how to obtain a set of self-consistent equations that can describe the lineshapes of quasiparticles. The only inputs needed for the resulting set of equations are the static Kubo correlation functions, which can be computed using path-integral molecular dynamics or approximated with (classical or ab initio) molecular dynamics.}},

  abstract = {{Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental–theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in‐plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat‐carrying modes around ≈0.1 THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out‐of‐plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD‐based (opto‐)electronic applications. Combined experimental–theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe2 crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in‐plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat‐carrying low‐frequency mode. Out‐of‐plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.}},

This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photovoltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead‐free alternative for optoelectronic applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photovoltaic activity of the lead‐based halide perovskites. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in lead‐based halide perovskites, the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 are investigated and are compared to its lead‐based analog, CsPbBr3. Using temperature‐dependent Raman measurements, it is found that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well‐defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal‐mode picture above 200 K. It is suggested that the breakdown of the normal‐mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our main findings, an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 is also discovered below ≈37 K. Raman spectroscopy is used to compare the anharmonic expressions in the structural dynamics of two halide perovskites. In Cs2AgBiBr6, clear normal modes are observed in all measured temperatures. Contrary to this, the Raman spectrum of CsPbBr3 exhibits a breakdown of the normal‐mode picture above 200 K. Implications of these diverging behaviors on the electronic properties of the crystals is discussed.}},

To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) method. This technique rigorously describes the full thermodynamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the SSCHA and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical inter pretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used for the implementation, which allows for a clean interaction with other packages. We briefly present a toy-model calculation to illustrate the potential of the code. Several applications of the method in superconducting hydrides, charge-density-wave materials, and thermoelectric compounds are also reviewed.}},

Strong anharmonicity near the phase transition induces non-Lorentzian shapes of the phonon power spectra.

Anharmonicity can potentially do both, even in perfect crystals, and simulations suggest that PbSe is anharmonic enough to support intrinsic localized modes that halt transport. Here, we experimentally observe high-temperature localization in PbSe using neutron scattering but find that localization is not limited to isolated modes – zero group velocity develops for a significant section of the transverse optic phonon on heating above a transition in the anharmonic dynamics. Arrest of the optic phonon propagation coincides with unusual sharpening of the longitudinal acoustic mode due to a loss of phase space for scattering. Our study shows how nonlinear physics beyond conventional anharmonic perturbations can fundamentally alter vibrational transport properties.

We show that the electron mobility in cubic SrTiO3 is controlled by scattering with longitudinal optical phonons at room temperature and with ferroelectric soft phonons below 200 K. Our calculations can accurately predict the temperature dependence of the electron mobility in SrTiO3 between 150–300 K, and reveal the microscopic origin of its roughly T-3 trend. Our approach enables first-principles calculations of e-ph interactions and charge transport in broad classes of crystals with phase transitions and strongly anharmonic phonons.}},

However, it only includes three-phonon scattering due to the assumption that four-phonon and higher-order processes are generally unimportant. Also, directly evaluating the scattering rates of four-phonon and higher-order processes has been a long-standing challenge. In this work, however, we have developed a formalism to explicitly determine quantum mechanical scattering probability matrices for four-phonon scattering in the full Brillouin zone, and by mitigating the computational challenge we have directly calculated four-phonon scattering rates. We find that four-phonon scattering rates are comparable to three-phonon scattering rates at medium and high temperatures, and they increase quadratically with temperature. As a consequence, κ of Lennard-Jones argon is reduced by more than 60\% at 80 K when four-phonon scattering is included. Also, in less anharmonic materials—diamond, silicon, and germanium—κ is still reduced considerably at high temperature by four-phonon scattering by using the classical Tersoff potentials. Also, the thermal conductivity of optical phonons is dominated by the fourth- and higher-orders phonon scattering even at low temperature.}},

We observe that higher-order correction is crucial to obtain accurate force constants from the trajectory with large atomic displacements.

The BTE approach successfully predicts the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD shows considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and carrying considerable heat.

The technique begins with the adoption of a trial ground-state wave function of the Jastrow form, together with trial excited-state wave functions constructed to represent one-, two-, and three-phonon excitations. The Hamiltonian matrix in this restricted basis is diagonalized, and the basis is optimized by minimizing the lowest eigenvalue with respect to variational phonon parameters. Using a lowest-order cluster expansion, the unambiguous prescription is obtained that a specific effective potential, softened by the Jastrow correlation function, replaces everywhere the true potential in the existing self-consistent theory of phonon damping applicable to nonsingular forces. Close analogies are drawn with the correlated basis function treatment, of superfluid liquid helium.}},

The crystal dynamics is approximated by a set of damped oscillators, and these are used to construct a trial action, analytically continued into the complex time-temperature plane. Using the action, a free-energy functional is required to be stationary with respect to the trial oscillators. The resulting phonon modes are undamped at the first order of approximation, whereas to second order the phonon spectral function is determined self-consistently. Expressions are obtained in first order for various thermodynamic derivatives, such as pressure, elastic constants, specific heats, and thermal expansion.}},

A perturbation procedure is developed to obtain the Green's functions and it is shown that for some purposes a quasi-harmonic approximation is useful, in which the frequencies of the normal modes are those determined by infra-red or neutron spectrometry. The thermodynamic, elastic, dielectric and scattering properties of an anharmonic crystal are discussed in terms of the Green's functions, and detailed expressions are given for the more important contributions. Detailed numerical calculations are presented of the thermal expansion, dielectric properties and shapes of some of the inelastically scattered neutron groups, for sodium iodide and potassium bromide. The calculations, which give reasonable agreement with experiment, show that even at quite low temperatures, the lifetimes of some of the normal modes can be quite short. By using the quasi-harmonic approximation it is shown that the large temperature dependence of the normal modes in a ferroelectric crystal can be treated adequately.}},
