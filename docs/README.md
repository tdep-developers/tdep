### Temperature dependent effective potential

All my phonon related codes, as well as some other stuff. It is implementing the methods published here:

Briefly summarized, the package provides all the tools you need to build accurate model Hamiltonians for finite temperature lattice dynamics from first principles. In addition, there are codes to extract numerous physical properties from these model Hamiltonians, including but not limited to:

* Temperature dependent phonon frequencies
* Free energy including anharmonic contributions
* Phonon spectral functions, linewidths and shifts
* Lattice thermal conductivity
