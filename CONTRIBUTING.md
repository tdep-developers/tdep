## Contribute Code via Pull Request

In order to contribute code to `TDEP`, please follow the usual steps for [preparing and creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) via your own [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks). A few remarks regarding our guidelines for code and code style:

- Some of us use [`fprettify`](https://github.com/pseewald/fprettify) to format the code, the respective command is:
  ```bash
  fprettify -i 4 -l 500 --disable-indent-mod file.f90
  ```

  This will format the code with an indent (`-i`) of 4 characters, without enforcing line breaks (`-l 500` allows up to 500 characters per line - please use less.)

- Please _document_ and _test_ your changes by providing an example in the [`./examples`](./examples) or [`./tests`](./tests) folder.
